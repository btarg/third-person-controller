The crosshair (controller only) stays in the middle of the screen. It locks on/moves towards characters that are nearby to it to aid in selection.
The player can also use quick select by clicking the turn order on mouse or using LB/RB to cycle (with wrap) between characters in the turn order.

Here are the actions I have planned based on their contexts, provided the player's current character is close enough to the target:

__When hovering currently played character:__
- Guard
- Cast/Item
- Analyse

__When hovering a player's ally__
- Cast/Item
- Analyse

__When hovering an enemy__
- Attack
- Cast/Item
- Draw
- Analyse

__When hovering an empty, traversible space on the map__
- Move
- Jump (when applicable)
